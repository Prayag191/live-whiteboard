# live-whiteboard
Live Whiteboard is a collaborative online whiteboard application backend built with Java Spring Boot and PostgreSQL. It allows multiple users to draw, write, and interact on a shared board in real-time. Every session, board, and shape is stored in the database, enabling users to save and revisit their work.
